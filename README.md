# Dictionary App ðŸ“—

This is a quite a basic dictionary app made in React. It provides you with definitions, examples and audio (if available). There is an option to switch to light mode. 

I used [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToXna81iij0&list=PL0j7cSa1-AjtEfP1VIwrBn7UQU2hMWerP&index=12) to build most of this site. 

Cheers!
